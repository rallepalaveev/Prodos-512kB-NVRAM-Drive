# Prodos-512kB-NVRAM-Drive
A card with 512kB NVRAM for Apple // compatible computers which is a ProDOS compliant R/W device.
This is a project based on my NVRAM card which is intended to work with NVRAM chip 39SF040 and compatible.
The NVRAM is organized in 256 banks of 2kB each, numbered #00 to #FF Banks are selected by writing a byte (#00 - #FF) into $C0Nx, where N = 8 + [slot number].
When writing to $C0Nx at the same time the NVRAM chip is also enabled. When a bank is selected, its contents are seen in the address space $C800-$CFFF.
To de-enable the NVRAM chip a write must be performed to address $CFFF or reset executed. If a user program is accessing the card,
it is important that at the end a write is performed to $CFFF so that the card is deactivated and does not conflict with other hardware,
which is using the same address space.
The bootloader is programmed in the highest 256 bytes of the chip. The boot loader is always available at addresses $CM00-$CMFF, where M = [slot number].
The bootloader can also be seen at addresses $CF00-$CFFF of bank #FF.
The image contains a ProDOS volume which is loaded by the boot loader. Additional firmware resides in ProDOS Block $01.
The card requires the presence of 64kB AUX memory, otherwise will be read only.
Recommended installation is on Slot 7. The boot loader has functionality that it captures the boot sequence of the computer and loads ProDOS.

As of hardware version 2.3 a major design change was implemented - an addition of a static RAM chip onboard to be used as a write buffer. This eliminates the need to use the AUX memory as a write buffer and makes the card even more compatible - for instance to programs which must use the AUX memory, like A2Desktop or /RAM disk of ProDOS. The card can be written to even in a computer with only 64kB of RAM. This leads to a new firmware versions - 38 and above, which has also been reduced to 512 bytes only and now completely fits in block #001. The firmware is accessed only via the 256-byte Slot memory by means of bank switching. The RAM chip is accessed in the C800 memory space alongside the NVRAM chip by alternating R/W access with a programming switch - when writing is enabled for the RAM, reading is enabled for the NVRAM and vice versa. Note: SW v.38 and later are not backwards compatible with HW versions below 2.3.
